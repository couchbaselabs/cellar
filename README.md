# Cellar

An experimental KV store, which implements an LSM on top of [Bolt](https://github.com/boltdb/bolt) segments.

## Status

**EXPERIMENTAL** â€“ the API is evolving and the implementation is new

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/couchbaselabs/cellar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/couchbaselabs/cellar)

## High Level Concept

- Data coming into Cellar is batched.  Each batch is written out to its own Bolt segment.
- Reads from Cellar must navigate all the live Bolt segments.
- Over time, you have too many segments, and must merge segments.

**NOTE**: if you can arrange to write all keys in a batch in sorted order, we can take advantage of Bolt's strengths.  One way to build batches and write them to Cellar in sorted order is to place [moss](https://github.com/couchbase/moss) in front of Cellar.  In the future we may offer another package to combine these two projects seamlessly.

## Features

- API inspired by Bolt
- But, only 1 bucket.  Support for nested or multiple buckets was removed.
- Configurable merge policies.  Currently only one really dumb implementation.

## Performance

Is this actually faster for any use cases?

We don't know yet.  This is an ongoing experiment.
